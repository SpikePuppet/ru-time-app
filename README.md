# Ru Time

## Introduction

This is a fun little app, which converts how much time we feel to how many years Ru feels. It's a fun time, where we can laugh and have fun. And the official version has foxes, which is neat!

## Details

This is just a fun little app. It's only for the iPhone, and currently only supports iOS 17 and up. There's currently no plans to expand that, but hey you never know what happens.

## Issues

If you have an issue, please feel free to either contact me at rhysjohnsdev@gmail.com or via any of the contact details in GitHub. You can also raise a ticket, which I think would be the best way to do it, as I'll keep an eye out for new tickets.

### Not

All the code is MIT licensed, though I've not included the official art we use since that is only available to the published version of this app.
